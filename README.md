The **Smart Electronic Voting System** is a decentralized, transparent, and secure e-voting platform that uses **Blockchain** and **Big Data** technologies.  
Our goal is to overcome the challenges of traditional and electronic voting—such as vote tampering, lack of transparency, and inefficiency—by introducing a **fully decentralized** solution that ensures security, anonymity, and scalability.

## Project Objectives

- **Guarantee transparency** in the voting process using Blockchain’s immutability.  
- **Ensure security** by preventing middle-man and DoS attacks through decentralized architecture.  
- **Protect voter identity** using off-chain ID verification and anonymized data storage.  
- **Enhance scalability and data analysis** using Big Data tools like Hadoop, MapReduce, and PySpark.  
- **Build a user-friendly voting interface** accessible to all users through Flask.

## System Architecture

The project combines two major technological pillars:

### Blockchain Layer
- **Smart Contracts:** Implemented in Solidity for secure vote storage and on-chain verification.  
- **Decentralization:** Votes and voter identifiers are stored on Ethereum’s blockchain via Web3.js.  
- **On-chain ID Verification:** Conducted using sandboxed smart contracts (Tenderly / Foundry / Remix IDE).  
- **Off-chain Data Management:** Voter details (name, ID, etc.) are securely stored in decentralized IPFS storage while ensuring anonymity.  

### Big Data Layer
- **MapReduce Framework:** Used to process large-scale voting data for aggregation and analysis.  
- **PySpark:** Used for advanced visualization—pie charts, histograms, and heatmaps to detect voting patterns and correlations.  
- **Scalability:** Capable of processing millions of votes efficiently in real-time scenarios.

## System Pipeline

1. **User Interface (Flask App):**
   - Voters authenticate using government-issued IDs or passports.  
   - The app ensures off-chain identity verification before allowing access to the voting module.

2. **Off-Blockchain Verification:**
   - The ID is verified against a secure government database.  
   - If verified, the user proceeds to vote; otherwise, the attempt is blocked.

3. **Smart Contract Deployment:**
   - Developed using Solidity and tested with **Tenderly Sandbox**, **Foundry Anvil**, and **Remix IDE**.  
   - Contracts handle voting, verification, and results storage on the Ethereum test network.

4. **Vote Storage:**
   - The blockchain stores immutable transaction hashes.  
   - Full datasets (voter info, anonymized IDs, timestamps) are stored off-chain using **IPFS**, linked via **CIDs (Content Identifiers)**.

5. **Data Extraction and Processing:**
   - Unhashed data from Ethereum and IPFS is retrieved and processed with **MapReduce** for counting and pattern analysis.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Processed results are visualized using **PySpark**—including demographic analysis, vote distribution, and correlation heatmaps.

## Security Mechanisms

- **Decentralization:** No single point of failure; resistant to DoS and data manipulation.  
- **Encryption:** End-to-end data encryption during communication.  
- **Smart Contract Verification:** Prevents unauthorized access and vote duplication.  
- **Middle-Man Attack Protection:** TLS-secured channels and anomaly detection mechanisms.  
- **Data Anonymization:** Ensures that voter identity cannot be linked to voting choice.

## Key Features

- **Fully decentralized voting ledger** ensuring transparency and immutability.  
- **Off-chain verification module** to protect voter data privacy.  
- **Real-time data analysis** with Hadoop and Spark for large-scale elections.  
- **User-friendly interface** built with Flask for accessibility.  
- **Advanced data visualization** to interpret election trends and insights.
